I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.kangwon.ac.kr/cse/) at [Kangwon National University](https://wwwk.kangwon.ac.kr/english/index.do). Previously, I was a postdoctoral research scientist at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Wook-Shin Han. Before that, I obtained my B.S. degree in Software Engineering from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/). My research interests include big data processing, query processing, and query optimization.
