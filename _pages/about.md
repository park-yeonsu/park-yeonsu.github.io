I am a postdoctoral research scientist at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/) [GSAI](https://ai.postech.ac.kr), working with Professor [Wook-Shin Han](https://wscrony.github.io). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng) under the supervision of Professor Wook-Shin Han. Prior to this, I received my B.S. degree in Software Engineering at [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/). My research interests include big data processing, database systems, query processing, and query optimization. Recently, I have been committed to developing new techniques to improve the ability of Apache Spark to process a massive number of small queries efficiently.
